/*

Lock and ReadWriteLock are two interfaces -> ReentrantLock is a class that implements Lock interface methods according to it and ReentrantreadWriteLock is a class that implements ReadWrite interface according to it.

ReentrantReadWriteLock contains two inner classes name ReadLock and WriteLock that implements Lock interface.

Doubt Question -> When ReadLock and WriteLock classes directly implements Lock interface then whats the need ReentrantReadWrite class ?

Answer -> ReadWriteLock provides two types of locks: readLock() and writeLock().
Multiple threads can acquire the read lock simultaneously, but the write lock is exclusive.
This ensures:
1) No readers can read while a writer is writing.
2) No writer can write while readers are reading or another writer is writing.
To coordinate between the read and write locks, we need a shared object that holds internal state like read count, write access flags, and waiting queues.
The ReentrantReadWriteLock class acts as this central coordinating object â€” it contains inner classes ReadLock and WriteLock, which both use the outer class's internal state to synchronize access properly.
